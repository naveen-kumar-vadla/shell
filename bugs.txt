-- fixed --
duplication of nodes
if there is an alias/variable l=ls
and if you again do alias/variable l='hello'
it will create new key_value node in list
then l=ls and l='hello' both will be there but if you ask you'll get only l=ls

split command with quotes
if you give a='hello everyone'
it takes only 'hello' and ignore that 'everyone''
if you give alias l='ls -l'
it takes only ls and ignore that -l

run command with quotes
it won't run command with single quotes
if you make an alias l='ls'
and run l it will give error command not found 'ls'
